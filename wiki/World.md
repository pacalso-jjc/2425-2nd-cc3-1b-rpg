# Setting
# Locations
1. **New Athaeci**
 -Once a city of riches, New Athaeci now stands as a quiet remnant of its former glory. White limestone buildings overlook the restless sea, their walls worn by time and salt. Fishermen gather at the docks, merchants haggle in the shaded markets, and old statues of forgotten heroes crumble beneath ivy and neglect.

2. **Aiaia's Sea**
 -A vast, shifting expanse where storms come without warning and the waves whisper of things unseen. Ships vanish into the mist, swallowed by the unknown. When the sky clears, a land emerges. A place unmarked on any map, where civilization lingers just beyond the shore.

3. **Yishiem Ruins**
 -Carved into the cliffs above a slow-moving black river, the ruins of Yishiem stands. Faded murals depict lovers lost to time, and the wind carries voices that do not belong to the living. Further down the river, the singing grows louder, almost inviting.

4. **Hoarder's Hollow**
-A cavern of endless trinkets and treasures, scattered as if left behind in haste. The deeper one goes, the stronger the compulsion to take something. But the weight of hoarded riches is heavier than it seems, and not all that glitters is safe to touch.

5. **Pythia Bazaar**
 -A winding marketplace beneath the earth, lit by lanterns that flicker unnaturally. Merchants in bone masks barter with goods that shift when unobserved. Chests grin with too many teeth, and the more one takes, the harder it is to leave.

6. **The Ashen Expanse**
 -A land where the sky burns red, and the ground is cracked from war. The Necromancers of the East and the Templars wage an endless battle, their dead soldiers rising again each dawn to continue the fight. A river of molten rock divides the battlefield, its flow slow and ominous.

7. **False Kingdom of Theseon**
 -A city of golden temples and towering marble halls, Theseon radiates wealth and power. Priests chant to silent gods, while banners of virtue conceal streets built on lies. Beneath its grandeur, corruption is apparent. Charity is a front, faith a weapon, and those who see the truth dare not speak it.

8. **Avernus Fields**
 -A vast plain bathed in a pale, unyielding moonlight. The air hums with distant whispers, and figures move in the shadows, neither alive nor truly dead. Warriors clash in battles long lost to time, and the ground beneath trembles with something trying to claw its way free.

9. **Perse's Manor**
 -A lone manor standing at the worldâ€™s edge, its halls lined with books that rewrite themselves. The frail old man who resides here speaks in riddles and half-truths, his stories too ancient to be his own. The walls seem to shift when unobserved, and the further one wanders inside, the harder it becomes to leave.

10. **The Gates of Ifikar**
 -Towering obsidian gates carved with the names of those who tried to pass and failed. Here waits Ifrit, wreathed in flame and shadow, his blade humming with power. Beyond these gates lies the way out, but none have ever crossed without paying a price.
